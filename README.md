### About me.

I'm a **Software Developer** currently specializing in **Quality Assurance**. My professional focus is on developing robust automated test scripts that capture critical functional flows and edge cases. I also design and optimize **CI/CD pipelines** to ensure these tests run efficiently in production environments.

In my personal time, I build applications aimed at reducing service costs, leveraging the democratization of software development. I back these projects with my strong background in **security testing** and **vulnerability detection** to ensure they are safe and scalable.
